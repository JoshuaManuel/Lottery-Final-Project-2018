# "Pick 4" Lottery Program

My 2018 Advanced Java final project. This program simulates a Pick 4 lottery. The user will be able to pick four unique numbers and compare them against the computer. If any of them match, the user will be awarded a "monetary prize." You can play as many times as you like.
